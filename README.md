Program Overview

This program is designed to calculate tax in a video game market (such as Hypixel SkyBlock) based on player earnings and shop activity. The earning formula used is:

Earning = (Player Property × 1%) + 10

Below is a table of daily performance data showing how tax rates influence player scores:

Day     Tax Rate     Score

684     1.000        103569.75  
739     0.999        110711.21  
821     0.998        109657.7  
876     0.997        104281.875  
1017    0.996        114610.11  
1141    0.995        106742.83  
1258    0.994        101864.07  
1675    0.993        102493.08  
2189    0.992        104878.64  
3500    0.991        108069.95  
13285   0.990        100935.18  

Conclusion

From the data above, we can observe that once the tax rate reaches 0.990 (effectively 1%), the market stabilizes. After this point, players are no longer able to consistently earn more than 100,000 in score. The last recorded day (13285) shows a significantly high number, indicating a plateau or system limit — effectively infinity in terms of program performance.

This 1% tax rate is the same percentage used in the earning formula, meaning the player's earnings and the tax cancel each other out. As a result, the market reaches an equilibrium where growth becomes unsustainable, and earnings level off.

In short, a 1% tax acts as a critical point that caps further growth, leading to a stable but non-increasing economy.
